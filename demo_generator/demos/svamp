That means there were 68 children on the bus before the 63 got off. 14 children remained on the bus, which means 54 children got on the bus. Therefore, 54 - 63 = -9. 9 more children got on the bus than those that got off.",

If he had made _____ cakes initially, how many more cakes did baker make than those he sold?\" Now let's think about what we know. We know that the baker sold 8 cakes and that he made 40 cakes initially. From this, we can calculate that the baker made 32 more cakes than those he sold.",
